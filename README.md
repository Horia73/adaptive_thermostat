# Adaptive Thermostat

This repository contains the **Adaptive Thermostat** custom integration for Home Assistant.

The integration provides a thermostat entity that adapts its behaviour based on environmental sensors and presets. A companion Lovelace card is included under `custom_components/adaptive_thermostat/www/`.

Install via [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) by adding this repository as a custom integration source.
