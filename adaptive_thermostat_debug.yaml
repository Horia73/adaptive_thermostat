# Adaptive Thermostat Debug Configuration
# Place this file in your Home Assistant config directory for reference

# Step 1: Check if all required entities exist
# Add these to your configuration.yaml temporarily to verify entities exist:

# Example temperature sensor (replace with your actual sensor)
# sensor:
#   - platform: template
#     sensors:
#       dormitor_temperature:
#         friendly_name: "Dormitor Temperature"
#         unit_of_measurement: "Â°C"
#         value_template: "20.5"

# Example heater switch (replace with your actual switch)
# switch:
#   - platform: template
#     switches:
#       dormitor_heater:
#         friendly_name: "Dormitor Heater"
#         value_template: "{{ states('input_boolean.dormitor_heater_dummy') }}"
#         turn_on:
#           service: input_boolean.turn_on
#           target:
#             entity_id: input_boolean.dormitor_heater_dummy
#         turn_off:
#           service: input_boolean.turn_off
#           target:
#             entity_id: input_boolean.dormitor_heater_dummy

# Helper input_boolean for testing
# input_boolean:
#   dormitor_heater_dummy:
#     name: "Dormitor Heater Test"
#     icon: mdi:radiator

# Step 2: Enable debug logging
# Add this to your configuration.yaml:
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.adaptive_thermostat: debug

# Step 3: Common troubleshooting steps:
# 1. Check Developer Tools > States for your configured entities
# 2. Verify entity IDs match exactly (case sensitive)
# 3. Check Home Assistant logs for errors
# 4. Restart Home Assistant after configuration changes
# 5. Clear browser cache and refresh

# Step 4: Verify integration is loaded
# Check in Settings > Devices & Services > Integrations
# You should see "Adaptive Thermostat" listed

# Step 5: Common entity naming issues
# Entity IDs must follow this pattern:
# - Only lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores
# - Must start with a letter
# - Examples: sensor.dormitor_temp, switch.radiator_bedroom

# Step 6: Check these entity patterns work:
# climate.dormitor (this is what will be created)
# sensor.temperature_dormitor (your temp sensor)
# sensor.outdoor_temperature (your outdoor sensor)
# switch.radiator_dormitor (your heater)

# If entity is still unavailable, check exact error in logs:
# grep -i "adaptive_thermostat\|dormitor" home-assistant.log
